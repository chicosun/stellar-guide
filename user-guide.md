# Chapter 3: A User Guide to Stellar
### Exploring the Stellar Blockchain
You can view the transactions and balance of any Stellar account using a Blockchain explorer. One popular option is [stellarchain.io](https://stellarchain.io). The home page shows the latest transactions and other statistics. To view the account specific details, you can search by the account public key, also know as the account **address**. Here is an example for the address [GCFXHS4GXL6BVUCXBWXGTITROWLVYXQKQLF4YH5O5JT3YZXCYPAFBJZB](https://stellarchain.io/address/GCFXHS4GXL6BVUCXBWXGTITROWLVYXQKQLF4YH5O5JT3YZXCYPAFBJZB). You can see the account balance and the list of transactions. While there are numerous transaction types, **Payment** is the most obvious one that shows a transfer from one address to another.

### Getting started with Stellar
There are many ways to create and manage a Stellar account. Here is a brief summary. We will look at each one in more detail later in this chapter.

#### Stellar Account Viewer
The Stellar Foundation maintains a simple web interface called [Stellar Account Viewer](https://www.stellar.org/account-viewer).It allows you to do common operations like creating an account and Lumen transfers.
Creating an account generates a **secret key**. Keep this a secret since this is how you get access to your account and authorize transactions. Also note that when you create an account this way, your account is inactive until you get someone to transfer a minimum of 1 Lumen to your account.


#### Wallets
Wallets are apps that allow you to create Stellar accounts, check balance and   transfer Lumens. Wallets can be applications for Desktop or Mobile, web sites or browser extensions. The Stellar team maintains a [list of known wallets](https://www.stellar.org/lumens/wallets/).  
#### Exchanges
Exchanges provide a way to buy and sell Lumens. They typically sport a trading interface and allow you transfer between Lumens and physical currencies (called **fiat currencies**). They also allow you to place orders to trade Lumens against other crypto currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
