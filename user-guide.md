# Chapter 3: A User Guide to Stellar
### Exploring the Stellar Blockchain
You can view the transactions and balance of any Stellar account using a Blockchain explorer. One popular option is [stellarchain.io](https://stellarchain.io). The home page shows the latest transactions and other statistics. To view the account specific details, you can search by the account public key, also know as the account **address**. Here is an example for the address [GCFXHS4GXL6BVUCXBWXGTITROWLVYXQKQLF4YH5O5JT3YZXCYPAFBJZB](https://stellarchain.io/address/GCFXHS4GXL6BVUCXBWXGTITROWLVYXQKQLF4YH5O5JT3YZXCYPAFBJZB). You can see the account balance and the list of transactions. While there are numerous transaction types, **Payment** is the most obvious one that shows a transfer from one address to another.
