# Chapter 6: Stellar Adoption
### Stellar Growth
Since its inception in 2014, Stellar has steadily grown in popularity but the year 2018 has seen a big surge in adoption. This can be seen by the growth in the number of accounts, trades and payments on the network. Here is a chart from [stellar.expert](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/)

### Products built on Stellar
While tools like wallets help you manage your Stellar accounts, the real measure of network adoption is when Stellar solves existing pain points and creates new opportunities for a new suite of products to built around Stellar. These broadly fall into the following categories:
  - Efficient cross-border payments
  - Custom Tokens and Assets
  - Micropayments
  - Enterprise solutions using a private/public hybrid network

The [Stellar Partner Directory](https://www.stellar.org/about/directory) maintains a growing list of Anchors and Companies that have built products on Stellar.
