### The Decentralized Payment Network
Blockchain's ability to append data in a tamper proof way means it can be used by a network of servers that are not centrally managed. This decentralized setup allows users to trust the transaction data stored in the blockchain without having to trust the users themselves. The combination of blockhain and  decentralization led to the massive popularity of Bitcoin and other crypto currencies that followed. The Stellar Network facilitates a similar decentralized payment network where anyone can add servers and participate in transaction processing.
