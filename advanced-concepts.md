### The Decentralized Payment Network
Blockchain's ability to append data in a tamper proof way means it can be used by a network of servers that are not centrally managed. This decentralized setup allows users to trust the transaction data stored in the blockchain without having to trust the users themselves. The combination of blockhain and  decentralization led to the massive popularity of Bitcoin and other crypto currencies that followed. The Stellar Network facilitates a similar decentralized payment network where anyone can add servers and participate in transaction processing.

### Stellar Consensus Protocol
### The Ledger
### Assets and Anchors
### Exchange and Orderbook
#### Stellar Distributed Exchange
In addition to handling payments, the Stellar network can act as a distributed exchange that allows trading of any type of asset users have added to the network.  These offers are stored in the Ledger.

#### Offers
You can make an offer to buy or sell an asset that you hold in your account.    Your offer can either be **filled** by previously made offers or be added to the **orderbook** and wait for matching orders.

#### Orderbook
The orderbook holds all active offers on the Stellar network with the bid and ask offers listed separately. This orderbook is independent of the orderbooks run by cryptocurrency exchanges. Here is a screenshot of the [orderbook on the Kraken exchange](https://www.kraken.com/charts) for the XLM/USD pair.
