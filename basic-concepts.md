# Chapter 1: Basic Concepts
### Account
Just like a bank account, you hold your money in an **Account** in Stellar. An account is identified by a **public key**. An example for a public key is 'GCFXHS4GXL6BVUCXBWXGTITROWLVYXQKQLF4YH5O5JT3YZXCYPAFBJZB'. If you know an account's public key, you can send money to that account. You can also view the account's transactions on the **public blockchain**. 

### The Stellar Blockchain
In traditional banking your account transactions are private, only visible to the account holder. Blockchain platforms like Stellar and Bitcoin are public. The transactions are recorded on the public blockchain and can be viewed by anyone along with the account balance.
