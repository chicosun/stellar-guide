### Account
Just like a bank account, you hold your money in an **Account** in Stellar. An account is identified by a **public key**. An example for a public key is 'GCFXHS4GXL6BVUCXBWXGTITROWLVYXQKQLF4YH5O5JT3YZXCYPAFBJZB'. If you know an account's public key, you can send money to that account. You can also view the account's transactions on the **public ledger**.
